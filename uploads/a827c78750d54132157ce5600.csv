We recognize solving this issue using the preferred method may not be feasible for all situations, so completing all of the numbered steps is an alternative solution to close this issue: 

1. Add all of the text from the image, and [any other visual information necessary for understanding](https://hub.accessible360.com/kb/articles/472), to an `alt` attribute on the image.
